# Topic Guides

This section of the documentation dives deep into individual parts of Brigade. We'll look at Brigade's architecture,
explore the three main roles of interaction with Brigade, go over Brigade's scripting API and much more.
This is probably where youâ€™ll want to spend most of your time; if you work your way through these guides you
should come out knowing pretty much everything there is to know about Brigade.

If you don't see a topic guide here and have a reasonable level of knowledge on the subject, why not [write one up][write]?
